### Market-Basket-Project-on-E-Commerce

This project covers a strategic data mining technique used by retailers to enhance sales by gaining a deeper understanding of customer purchasing patterns

This method entails the examination of substantial datasets, such as historical purchase records, in order to unveil inherent product groupings and identify items that tend to be bought together.

### INTERPRETATION AND INSIGHT
Dataset Information: 38,765 transaction records were initially available. 759 duplicates were identified and removed, resulting in 38,006 transaction records.

Algorithms Used: Apriori algorithm and FP-growth were implemented for association rule mining.

Top 10 Frequent Items: Identified the top 10 most frequently purchased items, including whole milk, other vegetables, rolls/buns, soda, yogurt, root vegetables, tropical fruit, bottled water, sausage, and citrus fruit.

Association Rule Metrics: The Apriori algorithm uses support, confidence, and lift for rule evaluation. A rule is mentioned involving the moderate association between the purchase of UHT-milk and beef, with a confidence of 13.4% and a lift of 1.12.

Whole Milk Analysis: Whole milk is highlighted as the item with the highest support value in basket analysis.

Top 5 Consequent Items with Whole Milk: Other vegetables, rolls/buns, soda, tropical fruit, and yogurt are the top 5 items frequently purchased alongside whole milk.

Consistent High Lift with Whole Milk: Regardless of the item chosen as an antecedent, whole milk consistently demonstrates a high lift value as a consequent.

RECOMMENDATION
Strategic Product Placement:

• Whole milk emerges as a significant driver of sales, being the item with the highest support value. This indicates that it is a staple product frequently purchased by customers.

• Retailers can strategically place complementary items like other vegetables, rolls/buns, soda, tropical fruit, and yogurt near the whole milk section to encourage additional purchases. This can lead to increased sales and a more satisfying shopping experience for customers.

Marketing and Promotional Strategies:

• Marketing efforts can be tailored to promote the top 5 consequent items with whole milk. Special promotions, discounts, or bundling strategies can be implemented to boost sales of these items when customers purchase whole milk.

• Given the consistent high lift value associated with whole milk regardless of the antecedent item, marketing campaigns focusing on whole milk are likely to have a positive impact on overall sales.

Cross-Selling Opportunities:

• Train sales staff to identify and suggest complementary items to customers at the point of sale. For instance, if a customer purchases Whole Milk, the staff can recommend other items like Other Vegetables, Rolls/Buns, Soda, Tropical Fruit, and Yogurt.

Inventory Management:

• Use the analysis to optimize inventory management. Ensure that items frequently purchased together are well-stocked and placed in convenient locations within the store to encourage additional sales.
